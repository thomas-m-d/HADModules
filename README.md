# Heartless Audio Devices Eurorack Modules
This repo includes all of the source code and schematics for my DIY eurorack module designs. These modules use
various versions of the Teensy Arduino-based microcontrollers (see https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) as their basis.
The source code is for use with the Arduino IDE (see https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and the
Teensyduino add-on library (see https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html). The schematics were produced
using KiCAD (see https://www.kicad-pcb.org/).
